# Dynamic Programming - Day 1

## Topic: Fibonacci using Memoization in C#

### Concepts:
- Recursion with memoization
- Top-down recursion
- Memoization technique to avoid repeated calculation
- Avoid repeated calculations for optimization

### Code Explanation:
Implemented top-down DP for Fibonacci sequence using a dictionary to cache results.

### Doubts:
- Kab kab dictionary use karna better hota hai than arrays?
### Fibonacci Series (Recursive) 
- Time Complexity O(2^n)
